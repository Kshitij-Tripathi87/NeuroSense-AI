# NeuroSense-AI
NeuroScan AI is a deep learning system that classifies brain tumors from MRI images into four categories:

Glioma - Tumors arising from glial cells
Meningioma - Tumors of the meninges
Pituitary Adenoma - Pituitary gland tumors
No Tumor - Healthy brain tissue

ðŸŽ¯ Key Highlights
âœ… Automatic Image Dimension Detection - Adapts to any dataset
